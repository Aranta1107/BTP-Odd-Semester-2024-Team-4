This is a repository for end-to-end process of loading a tokenizer, preparing datasets, fine-tuning pretrained models, translating texts, and evaluating the results using the BhaashikTantraE2EPrototype library.


The notebook provides a comprehensive setup for Google Colab to facilitate the end-to-end workflow for machine translation with BhaashikTantraE2EPrototype. You can copy the above cells into a Jupyter notebook file (`.ipynb`) and run them in Google Colab. Make sure to adapt paths and hyperparameters to your specific requirements!
